## Examples of close Sounds
1. Sawtooth Synth, it sounds at your each ears.
2. Kick Drum just comes in your face.
3. Cellos in the intro sounds like in a small chamber.
4. Snare Drum is still in the face but with the gated reverb it doesn't sound as close as the Kick Drum.
## Examples of distance sounds
1. The weird inharmonic percussion in the intro sounds from a distance corner in a large garage.
2. Xylophone in the intro sounds like in a huge hall and far from me.
3. The string like synth pad in the intro and last chorus sounds like a huge wall and have a distance from the listener.
4. The repeating synth in the verse at the center sounds like in a medium-sized chamber.
## Vocal sounds
1. The whispering starts from 1:02 sound just at your ears.
2. The lead vocal sounds like in a small chamber but in some repeating sentences such as from 3:01 it sounds like getting closer as the sentence goes.
3. The lower backing vocal doesn't seems so far in the space.
4. However the higher vocal sounds like a a very large concert hall and being very far from me.
