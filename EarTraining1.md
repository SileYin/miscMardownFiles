I found it very hard to compare the loudness of panned instruments and centered instruments, especially on headphones. Also, kick, snare and lead vocal isn't easy to determine which is louder since they occupy different spectrums.

## Instrument list ranked by loudness

1. Lead Acoustics Guitar or Mandolin
2. Lead Vocal
2. Backing Vocal
3. Snare
3. Hi-hats 
4. Kick Drum
4. Bass Guitar
4. Synth piccolo Lead
5. Strumming Acoustics Guitar
5. Filtered Sawtooth Pad

## Relative comparisons

I think the loudest instrument is the Lead Acoustics Guitar or Mandolin, which is about 4-5 times as loud as the Filtered Sawtooth Pad.
Strange mix, don't think it's meant for stereo playback system. Vocals, pad on right, guitars on left, drums and bass guitar are centered.
